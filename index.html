              Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me! My journey in computer science began in high school with a single course, knowing only that "it involves coding." Fast forward six years, and I’ve graduated from Western University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Throughout my studies, I gained a deep understanding of core concepts like data structures, software architecture, databases, and object-oriented design.

As I progressed, I realized that computer science is much more than just writing code—it's about problem-solving, critical thinking, and creating innovative solutions to complex challenges. I found myself drawn to projects that allowed me to apply these principles in real-world contexts, whether through coursework, personal projects, or internships. These experiences helped me solidify my passion for technology, and I’m excited to continue growing as a developer and contributing to meaningful projects in the industry.

                          During my time at Western, I was fortunate to complete a sixteen-month internship at J.D. Power as a QA Analyst. I worked across two teams: the sustain team, where I primarily resolved support tickets and ensured system stability, and the build team, where I tested a program called Admin SNI. My role required developing creative test cases to ensure comprehensive functionality and working extensively with SQL to compare car model data in the database. These experiences not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork and problem-solving in real-world scenarios.

                          Additionally, I collaborated closely with developers and project managers to identify issues early in the development cycle, which helped streamline the overall release process. This hands-on experience gave me a deeper understanding of software development workflows, and how quality assurance plays a critical role in delivering reliable and efficient software solutions. The internship also reinforced my ability to adapt to fast-paced environments while maintaining attention to detail, a skill that continues to benefit me in my professional career.

              Outside of work, I enjoy staying active through regular workouts at the gym, which not only help me stay fit but also serve as a great way to clear my mind and recharge after a busy day. Spending quality time with family and friends is also important to me, whether it’s catching up over a meal, enjoying shared activities, or simply hanging out. In addition to this, I love working on personal projects, particularly ones that challenge my creativity and help me sharpen my technical skills.

When I have some downtime, I indulge in watching TV shows and movies—I'm particularly drawn to superhero-themed content, though I like to mix it up with shows like Gossip Girl from time to time for a lighter, drama-filled contrast. I’m also an avid console gamer and love immersing myself in new game worlds, though I’ve had to scale back on playing sports due to a torn ACL—an injury that was tough to deal with, but it taught me a lot about patience and perseverance (maybe a story for another time!). Despite the setback, I still find ways to stay active and engaged in hobbies I enjoy.)

              I am currently developing an AI-powered Tic Tac Toe game in Python, with a focus on deepening my understanding of the Minimax algorithm. I've additionally added the ability to play a fully randomized version of tic tac toe where the CPU player mindlessly selections an option, however my primary goal is to explore how the Minimax function operates to determine the most optimal move in games like Tic Tac Toe. The Minimax algorithm, a classic decision-making approach used in game theory, evaluates possible game outcomes by simulating all potential moves and counter-moves, assuming that both players will play optimally. Through this project, I am gaining practical experience in implementing the Minimax algorithm, handling game states, and refining my understanding of recursion, as the function recursively assesses the value of each move, ultimately choosing the one that leads to the best possible outcome for the AI.

              To refresh and enhance my Python programming skills, which I haven't used extensively since my first year of university, I decided to undertake a personal project of creating a simple chess game. This project serves as a practical exercise to rebuild my proficiency in Python by applying object-oriented programming principles, managing complex data structures like the chessboard, and implementing game logic. Developing the chess game involves building classes for pieces, handling game rules such as legal moves, capturing, and check conditions, as well as designing an intuitive user interface for players to interact with.

In addition, I’m focusing on optimizing the game’s performance, ensuring efficient data handling and minimizing computational overhead during move processing. Debugging and testing different game scenarios have provided valuable insight into edge cases and error handling. Through this project, I’m not only sharpening my Python skills but also gaining hands-on experience with algorithmic thinking, such as move validation, state tracking, and potentially exploring more advanced concepts like AI-driven move suggestions. This chess game has become a rewarding challenge that deepens my understanding of both Python and game development fundamentals.Overall, it’s a comprehensive way for me to strengthen my coding foundation while working on a challenging yet rewarding project which can be found <a href = "https://github.com/royzhu0830/Basic-Chess-Game" target = "_blank">here!</a>

As part of my game design course, I created this game, which marked my first experience using Unity. From the beginning, learning to build a game from scratch was both exciting and challenging. I had to immerse myself in Unity's extensive interface and familiarize myself with its core components, such as physics, game objects, and scripting. Each element brought its own learning curve. For example, integrating physics to simulate realistic behaviors required understanding Unity's physics engine, while game objects and prefabs added complexity to organizing different elements in the game environment.

One of the most challenging aspects was scripting behaviors, such as collision detection, character movement, and game mechanics. I spent considerable time troubleshooting, testing, and experimenting to ensure these functions worked seamlessly. The process was not always smooth—debugging presented moments of frustration—but each issue I resolved strengthened my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of how game logic operates within Unity.

By the end of the project, seeing my game come together into a fully functioning product was incredibly satisfying. It gave me a profound appreciation for the intricacies of game development. This experience not only laid the foundation for my knowledge of Unity but also sparked a growing interest in exploring more advanced game mechanics and features in the future, such as AI, multiplayer capabilities, and procedural generation.
