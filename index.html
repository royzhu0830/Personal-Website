            <h1> About Me</h1>
            <p>
              Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me! My journey in computer science began in high school with a single course, knowing only that "it involves coding." Fast forward six years, and I’ve graduated from Western University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Throughout my studies, I gained a deep understanding of core concepts like data structures, software architecture, databases, and object-oriented design.
            </p>  
            <p>
              During my time at Western, I was fortunate to complete a sixteen-month internship at J.D. Power as a QA Analyst. I worked across two teams: the sustain team, where I primarily resolved support tickets and ensured system stability, and the build team, where I tested a program called "Admin SNI." My role required developing creative test cases to ensure comprehensive functionality and working extensively with SQL to compare car model data in the database. These experiences not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork and problem-solving in real-world scenarios.

            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of work, I enjoy staying active through working out at the gym, spending time with family and friends, and working on personal projects. I also enjoy watching TV shows and movies (particularly super hero stuff with an occasional gossip girl sprinkled in), and console gaming, though I’ve had to dial back on sports due to a torn ACL—maybe a story for another time!)
