              Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me! My journey in computer science began in high school with a single course, knowing only that "it involves coding." Fast forward six years, and I’ve graduated from Western University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Throughout my studies, I gained a deep understanding of core concepts like data structures, software architecture, databases, and object-oriented design.

              During my time at Western, I was fortunate to complete a sixteen-month internship at J.D. Power as a QA Analyst. I worked across two teams: the sustain team, where I primarily resolved support tickets and ensured system stability, and the build team, where I tested a program called "Admin SNI." My role required developing creative test cases to ensure comprehensive functionality and working extensively with SQL to compare car model data in the database. These experiences not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork and problem-solving in real-world scenarios.

              Outside of work, I enjoy staying active through working out at the gym, spending time with family and friends, and working on personal projects. I also enjoy watching TV shows and movies (particularly super hero stuff with an occasional gossip girl sprinkled in), and console gaming, though I’ve had to dial back on sports due to a torn ACL—maybe a story for another time!)

              I am currently developing an AI-powered Tic Tac Toe game in Python, with a focus on deepening my understanding of the Minimax algorithm. I've additionally added the ability to play a fully randomized version of tic tac toe where the CPU player mindlessly selections an option, however my primary goal is to explore how the Minimax function operates to determine the most optimal move in games like Tic Tac Toe. The Minimax algorithm, a classic decision-making approach used in game theory, evaluates possible game outcomes by simulating all potential moves and counter-moves, assuming that both players will play optimally. Through this project, I am gaining practical experience in implementing the Minimax algorithm, handling game states, and refining my understanding of recursion, as the function recursively assesses the value of each move, ultimately choosing the one that leads to the best possible outcome for the AI.

              To refresh and enhance my Python programming skills, which I haven't used extensively since my first year of university, I decided to undertake a personal project of creating a simple chess game. This project serves as a practical exercise to rebuild my proficiency in Python by applying object-oriented programming principles, managing complex data structures like the chessboard, and implementing game logic. Developing the chess game involves building classes for pieces, handling game rules, such as legal moves, capturing, and check conditions, as well as designing an intuitive user interface for players to interact with. Through this project, I’m not only sharpening my Python skills but also gaining hands-on experience with algorithmic thinking, such as move validation, state tracking, and potentially exploring more advanced concepts like AI-driven move suggestions. Overall, it’s a comprehensive way for me to strengthen my coding foundation while working on a challenging yet rewarding project which can be found <a href = "https://github.com/royzhu0830/Basic-Chess-Game" target = "_blank">here!</a>

              I created this game as part of my game design course, marking my first experience using Unity. Learning to build a game from scratch was both exciting and challenging, especially as I navigated Unity’s interface and components like physics, game objects, and scripting. I often had to troubleshoot and experiment to get behaviors like collision detection and character movement working properly, which strengthened my problem-solving skills. Despite the frustrations of debugging, seeing the game come together was incredibly satisfying and gave me a deep appreciation for game development. This experience laid the foundation for my understanding of Unity and sparked my interest in exploring more advanced game mechanics in the future.
